# What is Docker?

The word "DOCKER" refers to several things. This includes an open source community project; tools from the open source project; Docker Inc., the company that is the primary supporter of that project; and the tools that the company formally supports. The fact that the technologies and the company share the same name can be confusing.

Here's a quick explanation:

- The IT software "Docker” is containerization technology that enables the creation and use of Linux® containers.
- The open source Docker community works to improve these technologies to benefit all users—freely.
- The company, Docker Inc., builds on the work of the Docker community, makes it more secure, and shares those advancements back to the greater community. It then supports the improved and hardened technologies for enterprise customers.

With DOCKER, you can treat containers like extremely lightweight, modular virtual machines. And you get flexibility with those containers—you can create, deploy, copy, and move them from environment to environment, which helps optimize your apps for the cloud.

Docker is a computer program, command-line tool, a containerization platform, product & a company.

## Docker as a Computer program...

Docker is a computer program that performs operating-system-level virtualization, also known as "containerization". 
Docker is a command-line program, a background daemon, and a set of remote services that take a logistical approach to solving common software problems and simplifying
your experience installing, running, publishing, and removing software. It accomplishes this using a UNIX technology called containers
It was first released in 2013 and is developed by Docker, Inc.

## Docker as a Platform

Docker is a containerization platform that packages your application and all its dependencies together in the form of a docker container to ensure that 
your application works seamlessly in any environment.Docker Container is a standardized unit which can be created on the fly to deploy a particular application or environment. It could be an Ubuntu container, CentOs container, etc. to full-fill the requirement from an operating system point of view. Also, it could be an application oriented container like CakePHP container or a Tomcat-Ubuntu container etc.

## Docker as a Product

Docker is the leader in the containerization market, combining an enterprise-grade container platform with world-class services to give developers and IT alike the freedom to build, manage and secure applications without the fear of technology or infrastructure lock-in. Today’s organizations are under pressure to digitally transform their business but are con
