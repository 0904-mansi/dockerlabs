## Docker as a CLI tool

Docker is a command-line program, a background daemon, and a set of remote services that take a logistical approach to solving common software problems and simplifying

## Docker as a Platform

Docker is a containerization platform that packages your application and all its dependencies together in the form of a docker container to ensure that 
your application works seamlessly in any environment.Docker Container is a standardized unit which can be created on the fly to deploy a particular application or environment. It could be an Ubuntu container, CentOs container, etc. to full-fill the requirement from an operating system point of view. Also, it could be an application oriented container like CakePHP container or a Tomcat-Ubuntu container etc.

## Docker as a Product

Today’s organizations are under pressure to digitally transform their business but are constrained by a diverse portfolio of applications, clouds and premises-based infrastructures.
