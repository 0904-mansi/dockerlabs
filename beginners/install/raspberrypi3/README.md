# How to install Docker 18.09.1 on Raspberry Pi 3



##  Flash Raspbian OS on SD card

If you are in Mac, you might need to install Etcher tool. If on Windows, install SDFormatter to format SD card as well as Win32installer to flash Raspbian ISO image onto the SD card. You will need SD card reader to achieve this.


## Booting up Raspbian OS

### Enable SSH to perform remote login



```

If you would like to use Docker as a non-root user, you should now consider
adding your user to the "docker" group with something like:

  sudo usermod -aG docker your-user

Remember that you will have to log out and back in for this to take effect!

WARNING: Adding a user to the "docker" group will grant the ability to run
         containers which can be used to obtain root privileges on the
         docker host.
         Refer to https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/security/#docker-daemon-attack-surface
         for more information.
