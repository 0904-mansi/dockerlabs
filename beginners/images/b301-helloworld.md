## Explanation

So what’s happened here? We’ve called the docker run command, which is responsible for launching containers.

The argument hello-world is the name of the image someone created on dockerhub for us. It will first search for "hello-world" image locally and then search in Dockerhub.

Once the image has been downloaded, Docker turns the image into a running container and executes it.
