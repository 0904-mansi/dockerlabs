## What is a Dockerfile?

- A Dockerfile is a text file which contains a series of commands or instructions. 
- These instructions are executed in the order in which they are written.
- Execution of these instructions takes place on a base image. 
- On building the Dockerfile, the successive actions form a new image from the base parent image.

We will go through each of instructions under Dockerfile and see how it is used.
