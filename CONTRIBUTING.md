## Guidelines for Contributing

### How can I get involved?

There are 5 golden steps to get involved - 

- [Slack](https://collabnix.slack.com) is the best place to keep up to date with the project and to get help contributing. Here we exchange ideas, ask questions and chat about Dockerlabs.

- Ping [Ajeet S Raina](https://github.com/ajeetraina) with your email address so that an invite can be sent out. Once invite is received via email, click on the link to get connected to contributors, enthusiast and active community members.

- Introduce yourself to the Slack Group.

- Search for channels(like #docker-networking, #docker-volumes, #docker101 etc.) and join the channel.

- Show your interest by choosing the topic of your interest and start contributing

## How can I contribute?

There are a number of areas where contributions can be accepted:

* Submit your tutorial for DockerLabs(preferrably on Play with Docker Platform)
* Using Play with Docker Platform to build Docker Ready Solution
* Review pull requests
* Test and verify tutorials submitted by community users
* Get involved in design reviews and technical proof-of-concepts (PoCs)
* Manage, triage and research Issues and Pull Requests
* Engage with the growing community by providing technical support on Slack/GitHub
* Create docs, guides and write blogs to share

#### Wait..I have a question, a suggestion or need help

If you have a simple question you can [join the Slack community](https://collabnix.slack.com) and ask there. 

### I am new to GitHub. Is it possible for me to contribute?

Yes, you can still submit your tutorial to us. One of us will review and add it on behalf of you.
But it is highly recommended to learn [GitHub](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) so that it saves lot of time in uploading your tutorial.
