## Guidelines

Guidelines for contributing.

### How can I get involved?

[Slack](https://collabnix.slack.com) is the best place to keep up to date with the project and to get help contributing. Here we exchange ideas, ask questions and chat about Dockerlabs.

There are a number of areas where contributions can be accepted:

* Using Play with Docker Platform to build Docker Container
* Using Play with Docker Platform to build Docker Ready Solution
* Review pull requests
* Test out new features or work-in-progress
* Get involved in design reviews and technical proof-of-concepts (PoCs)
* Manage, triage and research Issues and Pull Requests
* Engage with the growing community by providing technical support on Slack/GitHub
* Create docs, guides and write blogs


This is just a short list of ideas, if you have other ideas for contributing please make a suggestion.

### Paperwork for Pull Requests

Please read this whole guide and make sure you agree to the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) agreement (included below):

* See guidelines on commit messages (below)
* Sign-off your commits (`git commit --signoff` or `-s`)
* Complete the whole template for issues and pull requests
* [Reference addressed issues](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords/) in the PR description & commit messages - use 'Fixes #IssueNo' 
* Always give instructions for testing
 * Provide us CLI commands and output or screenshots where you can

#### Wait..I have a question, a suggestion or need help

If you have a simple question you can [join the Slack community](https://collabnix.slack.com) and ask there, but please bear in mind that contributors may live in a different timezone or be working to a different timeline to you. If you have an urgent request then let them know about this.

If you have a deeply technical request or need help debugging your application then you should prepare a simple, public GitHub repository with the minimum amount of code required to reproduce the issue. 

If you feel there is an issue with OpenFaaS or were unable to get the help you needed from the Slack channels then raise an issue on one of the GitHub repositories.

### How do I become a maintainer?

In the DockerLabs community there are three levels of maintainership:

* Core Contributors
* GitHub Organisation Members
* Those with Derek access

### Slack

There is an Slack community which you are welcome to join to discuss DockerLabs. Ping [Ajeet S Raina](https://github.com/ajeetraina) with your email address so that an invite can be sent out.

Please send in a short one-line message about yourself to ajeetraina@gmail.com so that we can give you a warm welcome and help you get started.
