# How to install Helm on Docker Desktop for Mac


## Pre-requisite:

- Ensure that Helm is properly installed
- Ensure that ```helm version``` displays error-free output 


## Note: In case you encounter the below error message:

```
[Captains-Bay]ðŸš© >  helm version
Client: &version.Version{SemVer:"v2.12.1", GitCommit:"02a47c7249b1fc6d8fd3b94e6b4babf9d818144e", GitTreeState:"clean"}
Error: could not find tiller
```

Follow the below steps to fix the issue:

```
[Captains-Bay]ðŸš© >  helm init --service-account tiller
$HELM_HOME has been configured at /Users/ajeetraina/.helm.

Tiller (the Helm server-side component) has been installed into your Kubernetes Cluster.

Please note: by default, Tiller is deployed with an insecure 'allow unauthenticated users' policy.
To prevent this, run `helm init` with the --tiller-tls-verify flag.
For more information on securing your installation see: https://docs.helm.sh/using_helm/#securing-your-helm-installation
Happy Helming!
