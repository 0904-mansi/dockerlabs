# How to install Heapster using Helm on Docker Desktop for Mac


## Pre-requisite:

- Ensure that Helm is properly installed
- Ensure that ```helm version``` displays error-free output 


## Note: In case you encounter the below error message:

```
[Captains-Bay]ðŸš© >  helm version
Client: &version.Version{SemVer:"v2.12.1", GitCommit:"02a47c7249b1fc6d8fd3b94e6b4babf9d818144e", GitTreeState:"clean"}
Error: could not find tiller
```

Follow the below steps to fix the issue:

```
[Captains-Bay]ðŸš© >  helm init --service-account tiller
$HELM_HOME has been configured at /Users/ajeetraina/.helm.

Tiller (the Helm server-side component) has been installed into your Kubernetes Cluster.

Please note: by default, Tiller is deployed with an insecure 'allow unauthenticated users' policy.
To prevent this, run `helm init` with the --tiller-tls-verify flag.

### ERROR: The metrics.k8s.io/v1beta1 API service is not enabled in the cluster      ###
########################################################################################
You have disabled the API service creation for this release. As the Kubernetes version in the cluster 
does not have metrics.k8s.io/v1beta1, the metrics API will not work with this release unless:

Option A: 

  You complete your metrics-server release by running:

  helm upgrade collabmetric bitnami/metrics-server \
    --set apiService.create=true

Option B:
  
   You configure the metrics API service outside of this Helm chart
```


```
helm upgrade collabmetric bitnami/metrics-server \
>     --set apiService.create=true

command:

  kubectl get --raw "/apis/metrics.k8s.io/v1beta1/nodes"
  
```

```
