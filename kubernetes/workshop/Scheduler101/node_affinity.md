# What is node affinity ?

- In simple words this  allows you to tell Kubernetes to schedule pods only to specific subsets of nodes.
- The initial node affinity mechanism in early versions of Kubernetes was the nodeSelector field in the pod specification. The node had to include all the labels specified in that field to be eligible to become the target for the pod.
## nodeSelector
## Steps

```
git clone https://github.com/collabnix/dockerlabs
cd dockerlabs/kubernetes/workshop/Scheduler101
kubectl apply -f pod-nginx.yaml
```

- We have label on the node which having ssd  disk. 

## Viewing Your Pods

```
kubectl get pods --output=wide
```
```

- You can check in above output  Node-Selectors:  disktype=ssd

## Deleting the Pod
```
kubectl delete -f pod-nginx.yaml
pod "nginx" deleted
```


# Node affinity

- Node affinity is conceptually similar to nodeSelector â€“ it allows you to constrain which nodes your pod is eligible to be scheduled on, based on labels on the node.

- There are currently two types of node affinity.
1. requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution  (Preferred during scheduling, ignored during execution; we are also known as "hard" requirements)
2. preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution  (Required during scheduling, ignored during execution; we are also known as "soft" requirements)

## Steps

```
git clone https://github.com/collabnix/dockerlabs
cd dockerlabs/kubernetes/workshop/Scheduler101
kubectl apply -f pod-with-node-affinity.yaml
```

## Step  Cleanup

Finally you can clean up the resources you created in your cluster:
```
kubectl delete -f pod-with-node-affinity.yaml
```
