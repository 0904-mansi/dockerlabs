# How to setup 3 Node Kubernetes Cluster on VMware vSphere ESXi VMs?

## Preparing the Infrastructure

- Machine #1: 100.98.26.206
- Machine #2: 100.98.26.210
- Machine #3: 100.98.26.213

## Assign hostname to each of these systems:

```
~$ cat /etc/hosts
127.0.0.1       localhost
127.0.1.1       ubuntu1804-1
100.98.26.206    kubemaster.dell.com
100.98.26.210   node1.dell.com
100.98.26.213   node2.dell.com
```

If you would like to use Docker as a non-root user, you should now consider
adding your user to the "docker" group with something like:

  sudo usermod -aG docker cse

Remember that you will have to log out and back in for this to take effect!

WARNING: Adding a user to the "docker" group will grant the ability to run
         containers which can be used to obtain root privileges on the
         docker host.
         Refer to https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/security/#docker-daemon-attack-surface
         for more information.

## Add the Kubernetes signing key on both the nodes

```
$ sudo curl -s https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg | sudo apt-key add
OK
```

## Adding Xenial Kubernetes Repository on both the nodes

```
sudo apt-add-repository "deb http://apt.kubernetes.io/ kubernetes-xenial main"
```

## Installing Kubeadm

```
sudo apt install kubeadm
```

## Verifying Kubeadm installation

```
$ sudo kubeadm version
kubeadm version: &version.Info{Major:"1", Minor:"15", GitVersion:"v1.15.0", GitCommit:"e8462b5b5dc2584fdcd18e6bcfe9f1e4d970a529", GitTreeState:"clean", BuildDate:"2019-06-19T16:37:41Z", GoVersion:"go1.12.5", Compiler:"gc", Platform:"linux/amd64"}
```

## Disable swap memory (if running) on both the nodes

```
sudo swapoff -a
```

```
