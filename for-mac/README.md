# Docker for Mac Tips & Tricks

## #1: How to change hostname of Swarm Node under Docker for Mac?

```
docker run -it --privileged --pid=host justincormack/nsenter1 /bin/sh -c "hostname foobar"
```

```

DOCKER_ORCHESTRATOR=swarm docker node ls
ID                            HOSTNAME            STATUS              AVAILABILITY        MANAGER STATUS      ENGINE VERSION
oumrrgu03r2r8ml7zlec5kozb *   foobar              Ready               Active              Leader              18.05.0-ce-rc1
```

## #2: How to fix "docker node ls is not supported" error?

```
[Captains-Bay]ðŸš© >  docker node ls
docker node ls is only supported on a Docker cli with swarm features enabled
```
```
[Captains-Bay]ðŸš© DOCKER_ORCHESTRATOR=swarm docker node ls
ID                            HOSTNAME                STATUS              AVAILABILITY        MANAGER STATUS      ENGINE VERSION

```

## #3: If Docker for Mac is built with LinuxKit. How shall I verify that the service container is running inside Linuxkit VM?


You can enter into LinuxKit VM with the below command:

```
screen ~/Library/Containers/com.docker.docker/Data/com.docker.driver.amd64-linux/tty

```


```
ctr -n services.linuxkit tasks ls
TASK                    PID     STATUS
acpid                   854     RUNNING
diagnose                898     RUNNING
docker-ce               936     RUNNING
host-timesync-daemon    984     RUNNING
ntpd                    1025    RUNNING
trim-after-delete       1106    RUNNING
vpnkit-forwarder        1157    RUNNING
vsudd                   1198    RUNNING
```

## #4:  How to use `docker-clean` utility?

```

$brew install docker-clean
```

```
[Captains-Bay]ðŸš© >  docker-clean
No images to delete!
No dangling volumes!
Removing empty networks..
```

## #5: I dont see Kubernetes Option listed under Preference Pane. What shall I do?

For those folks experiencing difficulty with Kubernetes, or for issues where Kubernetes is not showing up as an icon in the Docker menu/or Docker dialogue box, I'm providing information on how to install/set-up Kubernetes on your Mac operating system.

1). Kubernetes is only available in Docker-for-Mac 17.12 CE and higher, ONLY on the edge channel.

2). Docker-for-Mac 17.12 CE and higher, Edge includes a standalone Kubernetes server that runs on Mac, so that you can test deploy your workloads on Kubernetes. The client command, kubectl is included in your package and configured to connect to your Kubernetes server. What most folks fail to do after installation is to check to verify that kubectl is installed and pointing to Docker-for desktop. Sometimes, due to configurations, or due to mishaps, kubectl ends up pointing to the wrong environment, which could cause a whole host of issues. If kubectl is pointing toward another environment you have to change context to get it pointing to the correct environment. If you install kubectl with homebrew or some other method other than Docker-for-Mac, and you are experiencing difficulties, remove /usr/local/bin//kubectl. To enable Kubernetes, click on enable Kubernetes, and click the apply and restart button.

3). For those of you not seeing a Kubernetes icon after installation, you can still install Kubernetes as a standalone, if need be, for developmental purposes only. Install NodeJS & Docker Runtime for Mac.
4). Install Homebrew.
5). Install Xyve Driver (or Hyperkit Driver).
6). Install Minikube.
7). Install Kubectl.
8). Start Minikube.
9). Access Kubernetes Dashboard.
10). Minikube Commands for Kubernetes.
