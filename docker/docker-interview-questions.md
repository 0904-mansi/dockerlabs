# Serverless Interview Questions

## What is Serverless and why is it important?

Serverless allows you to build and run applications and services without thinking about servers. It eliminates infrastructure management tasks such as server or cluster provisioning, patching, operating system maintenance, and capacity provisioning. You can build them for nearly any type of application or backend service, and everything required to run and scale your application with high availability is handled for you.

## Why use serverless?

Serverless enables you to build modern applications with increased agility and lower total cost of ownership. Building serverless applications means that your developers can focus on their core product instead of worrying about managing and operating servers or runtimes, either in the cloud or on-premises. This reduced overhead lets developers reclaim time and energy that can be spent on developing great products which scale and that are reliable.

## What are the benefits of serverless?

- NO SERVER MANAGEMENT

There is no need to provision or maintain any servers. There is no software or runtime to install, maintain, or administer


- FLEXIBLE SCALING

Your application can be scaled automatically or by adjusting its capacity through toggling the units of consumption (e.g. throughput, memory) rather than units of individual servers.

- PAY FOR VALUE

Pay for consistent throughput or execution duration rather than by server unit.

- AUTOMATED HIGH AVAILABILITY

Serverless provides built-in availability and fault tolerance. You don't need to architect for these capabilities since the services running the application provide them by default
