# Serverless Interview Questions

## What is Serverless and why is it important?

Serverless allows you to build and run applications and services without thinking about servers. It eliminates infrastructure management tasks such as server or cluster provisioning, patching, operating system maintenance, and capacity provisioning. You can build them for nearly any type of application or backend service, and everything required to run and scale your application with high availability is handled for you.

## Why use serverless?

Serverless enables you to build modern applications with increased agility and lower total cost of ownership. Building serverless applications means that your developers can focus on their core product instead of worrying about managing and operating servers or runtimes, either in the cloud or on-premises. This reduced overhead lets developers reclaim time and energy that can be spent on developing great products which scale and that are reliable.

## What are the benefits of serverless?

- NO SERVER MANAGEMENT

There is no need to provision or maintain any servers. There is no software or runtime to install, maintain, or administer


- FLEXIBLE SCALING

Your application can be scaled automatically or by adjusting its capacity through toggling the units of consumption (e.g. throughput, memory) rather than units of individual servers.

- PAY FOR VALUE

Pay for consistent throughput or execution duration rather than by server unit.

- AUTOMATED HIGH AVAILABILITY

Serverless provides built-in availability and fault tolerance. You don't need to architect for these capabilities since the services running the application provide them by default.

# Tell something about the AWS Serverless Platform?

AWS provides a set of fully managed services that you can use to build and run serverless applications. Serverless applications donâ€™t require provisioning, maintaining, and administering servers for backend components such as compute, databases, storage, stream processing, message queueing, and more. You also no longer need to worry about ensuring application fault tolerance and availability. Instead, AWS handles all of these capabilities for you. This allows you to focus on product innovation while enjoying faster time-to-market.

## COMPUTE

### AWS Lambda

AWS Lambda lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. You pay only for the compute time you consume - there is no charge when your code is not running.

### AWS Fargate

AWS Fargate is a purpose-built serverless compute engine for containers. Fargate scales and manages the infrastructure required to run your containers.


## STORAGE

Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) provides developers and IT teams with secure, durable, highly-scalable object storage. Amazon S3 is easy to use, with a simple web service interface to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the web.

## Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) 

It provides simple, scalable, elastic file storage. It is built to elastically scale on demand, growing and shrinking automatically as you add and remove files. 

## DATA STORES

Amazon DynamoDB is a fast and flexible NoSQL database service for all applications that need consistent, single-digit millisecond latency at any scale.

## API PROXY

Amazon API Gateway is a fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale. It offers a comprehensive platform for API management. API Gateway allows you to process hundreds of thousands of concurrent API calls and handles traffic management, authorization and access control, monitoring, and API version management.

## APPLICATION INTEGRATION

Amazon SNS is a fully managed pub/sub messaging service that makes it easy to decouple and scale microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications.

## ORCHESTRATION

AWS Step Functions makes it easy to coordinate the components of distributed applications and microservices using visual workflows. Building applications from individual components that each perform a discrete function lets you scale and change applications quickly. Step Functions is a reliable way to coordinate components and step through the functions of your application.

## ANALYTICS

Amazon Kinesis is a platform for streaming data on AWS, offering powerful services to make it easy to load and analyze streaming data, and also providing the ability for you to build custom streaming data applications for specialized needs.

## DEVELOPER TOOLING

AWS provides tools and services that aid developers in the serverless application development process. AWS and its partner ecosystem offer tools for continuous integration and delivery, testing, deployments, monitoring and diagnostics, SDKs, frameworks, and integrated development environment (IDE) plugins.
